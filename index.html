    <h1>Catch Me If You Can't - Analysis of A.I Content Detectors</h1>

    <h2>The AI</h2>
    <p> The advent of Artificial Intelligence technology this past year has proven a challenge to American educational institutions. Natural Language Processors in these technologies are designed to produce output as similar to human writing as possible.
        Thus, students have rushed to use generative A.I like chatGPT to aid in their homework assignments, and teachers have alike rushed to find ways to restrain and monitor the usage of this technology for plagiarism.</p>

    <p>While the use of A.I in American educational institutions is no new feat,` the improvement of Natural Language Processors like ChatGPT to produce output as similar to human writing as 
        possible has created a rush of students using it to aid in completing their assignments. Dozens of companies have similarly rushed to capitalize on the new demand, creating technologies 
        to generate resumes, develop study guides, create powerpoint presentations, and more. 
    </p>

    <p>As such, teachers have been feeling overwhelmed with the need to restrain and monitor the usage of generative A.I for plagiarism. In January of 2023, the New York Department of Education 
        went so far as to ban usage of chatGPT in schools entirely as they believed it would detract from students meaningful learning.

        But, it seems as though a guardian angel has appeared in the form of an A.I Content Detector. These tools, of which there is a daunting amount to choose from, all promise to distinguish 
        with near perfect accuracy whether a given text is human-written or A.I generated. For educators across the county, this tool presents itself as a holy grail, but the reality is far less golden.

    <p> I am a student at Wellesley College studying Computer Science and Economics. I enjoy combining my interests in art and computer science with my desire to inform people in effective and lasting ways. </p>
