            <p> The advent of Artificial Intelligence technology this past year has proven a challenge to American educational institutions. Natural Language Processors in these technologies are designed to produce output as similar to human writing as possible.
                Thus, students have rushed to use generative A.I like chatGPT to aid in their homework assignments, and teachers have alike rushed to find ways to restrain and monitor the usage of this technology for plagiarism.</p>

            <p>While the use of A.I in American educational institutions is no new feat,` the improvement of Natural Language Processors like ChatGPT to produce output as similar to human writing as 
                possible has created a rush of students using it to aid in completing their assignments. Dozens of companies have similarly rushed to capitalize on the new demand, creating technologies 
                to generate resumes, develop study guides, create powerpoint presentations, and more.

        <div id="the-AI-text3">
            <p>As such, teachers have been feeling overwhelmed with the need to restrain and monitor the usage of generative A.I for plagiarism. In January of 2023, the New York Department of Education 
                went so far as to ban usage of chatGPT in schools entirely as they believed it would detract from students meaningful learning.

                But, it seems as though a guardian angel has appeared in the form of an A.I Content Detector. These tools, of which there is a daunting amount to choose from, all promise to distinguish 
                with near perfect accuracy whether a given text is human-written or A.I generated. For educators across the county, this tool presents itself as a holy grail, but the reality is far less golden.

            <p> Unfortunately, there are increasing reports of false positives when these detectors flag human writing as AI - like this high school senior who was accused of likely generating her essay with chatGPT 
                by the AI writing detector from Turnitin. With so many detectors to choose from, and little evaluation or credible research conducted on these tools, teachers are left with a daunting amount of options 
                to choose from, and students are left vulnerable to a skewed system of judgment if educators choose detectors that arent accurate. </p>

                This necessitates a reevaluation of these tools and the methods used to integrate A.I into the classroom as a whole.

            This research project examines the accuracy of three popular A.I Content Detectors when faced with excerpts of human writing, mixed source content, and AI-generated text. I intended to bring attention 
            to the potential harmful consequences of false claims of plagiarism, and to understand the reliability of our defense mechanisms against innovative technology.

                A.I Content Detectors have emerged recently as a method of defense against students using chatGPT in school assignments. Reports from the Washington Post, and other credible sources have found these detectors
                to be significantly unreliable, misidentified portions of selected text. In addition to reporting false positives, these detectors have also been found b to be biased against non-native english speakers, flagging their writing as A.I more often than native speakers (Liang et al).
            </p>
            <p>
                Most detectors can be classified into three categories:
            </p>

        <div id="the-background-text2">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Watermarking algorithms</strong></li>
                <p> Watermarking algorithms take advantage of the modifications specifically in A.I generated text, in which random subsets of vocabulary are “watermarked”. These watermarks are undetectable to humans, and can be found using specific  algorithms. There are no commercial watermarking 
                    algorithms on the market but researchers like Kirchbauer et al have developed some to use for their work. </p>
                
                <li><strong>Statistical outlier detection methods</strong></li>
                <p> Statistical outlier detection algorithms aim to distinguish between human written and AI generated based on outliers in specific qualities like burstiness (consistency in style and tone through the text) or perplexity (having an AI model to generate the next word and compare that 
                    generated to the next word in the text). As such, they use A.I algorithms themselves. Three of the four detectors I will be testing use methods similar to this.</p>
                
                <li><strong>Classifiers that discriminate AI generated from human written.</strong></li>
                <p> Classifiers are language models themselves that are trained on large datasets of both AI generated and human-written text to be able to distinguish between the two. The only available text classifier, OpenAI Text Classifier, I intended to use was taken down as of July 20th, 2023, 
                    due to “its low rate of accuracy.”</p>

            <p>
                The three A.I content detectors I will be evaluating are: GPTZero, Winston A.I, and Originality.ai. These three detectors were chosen based on various criteria. Either they are easily accessible on the internet by teachers, they have been cited as being used often by educators, or they have 
                been used in other studies testing the reliability of A.I.

            <p> <a href="https://gptzero.me/">GPTZero</a> is a detector developed by Princeton University student, Edward Tian. It is a statistical 
                outlier detector that returns a document-level score, “completely_generated_prob” that specifies the 
                probability the entire document was AI-generated. More information about the specifics of its technology 
                can be found at <a href="https://gptzero.me/technology">their webpage</a>. GPTZero recommend multiple ways to reduce the risk of misuse, including: “set 
                expectations for your students that you will be checking the work through an AI detector like GPTZero, to deter misuse of AI.”

                LLMs like Claude and GPT-4. It seems to be a statistical outlier detector, but the details published by Winston 
                AI are vague and unclear. Gives you a percentage score of odds that the text is generated by human or A.I In regards
                to AI misuse, they urge teachers that “while technology can be helpful in identifying potential issues, building trust 
                and rapport with your students can encourage them to be honest and genuine in their academic endeavors.”

                Detector.” Using software from Google, it has developed technology combining the classifier method and statistical outlier
                detector. It returns a percentage of how much AI is written and how much is human generated. ... Theyve said anything
