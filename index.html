            <p> The advent of Artificial Intelligence technology this past year has proven a challenge to American educational institutions. Natural Language Processors in these technologies are designed to produce output as similar to human writing as possible.
                Thus, students have rushed to use generative A.I like chatGPT to aid in their homework assignments, and teachers have alike rushed to find ways to restrain and monitor the usage of this technology for plagiarism.</p>

            <p>While the use of A.I in American educational institutions is no new feat,` the improvement of Natural Language Processors like ChatGPT to produce output as similar to human writing as 
                possible has created a rush of students using it to aid in completing their assignments. Dozens of companies have similarly rushed to capitalize on the new demand, creating technologies 
                to generate resumes, develop study guides, create powerpoint presentations, and more.

            <p>As such, teachers have been feeling overwhelmed with the need to restrain and monitor the usage of generative A.I for plagiarism. In January of 2023, the New York Department of Education 
                went so far as to ban usage of chatGPT in schools entirely as they believed it would detract from students meaningful learning.

                But, it seems as though a guardian angel has appeared in the form of an A.I Content Detector. These tools, of which there is a daunting amount to choose from, all promise to distinguish 
                with near perfect accuracy whether a given text is human-written or A.I generated. For educators across the county, this tool presents itself as a holy grail, but the reality is far less golden.

        <h2> The Problem </h2>
        <p> Unfortunately, there are increasing reports of false positives when these detectors flag human writing as AI - like this high school senior who was accused of likely generating her essay with chatGPT 
            by the AI writing detector from Turnitin. With so many detectors to choose from, and little evaluation or credible research conducted on these tools, teachers are left with a daunting amount of options 
            to choose from, and students are left vulnerable to a skewed system of judgment if educators choose detectors that arent accurate. </p>
            
        <p>
            This necessitates a reevaluation of these tools and the methods used to integrate A.I into the classroom as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
            This research project examines the accuracy of three popular A.I Content Detectors when faced with excerpts of human writing, mixed source content, and AI-generated text. I intended to bring attention 
            to the potential harmful consequences of false claims of plagiarism, and to understand the reliability of our defense mechanisms against innovative technology.
